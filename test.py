As you progress, learn about database design, normalization, and query optimization. Hands-on practice with real data will strengthen your skills and prepare you for complex tasks.",

Databases can store various types of data, such as text, numbers, and images, and are used in applications ranging from websites to business management systems. They are typically structured using tables, where data is organized into rows and columns, making it easy to search and manage. Databases can be relational (using SQL) or non-relational, depending on how data is stored and accessed.",

Follow the installation prompts, and for most users, the default settings are sufficient. Be sure to include the MySQL Workbench component if asked. After the installation finishes, click 'Finish' to complete the process, and on macOS, drag the MySQL Workbench icon to the Applications folder. Finally, launch MySQL Workbench from your application menu (Windows) or the Applications folder (macOS), and you're ready to connect to a MySQL server and manage your databases.",

    "Introduction to Query": {
        "text": "Basic SQL queries are used to interact with data in a database. The SELECT statement retrieves data, like SELECT * FROM employees; to fetch all records. The WHERE clause filters results, for example, SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';. The INSERT INTO statement adds new records, such as INSERT INTO employees (name, department) VALUES ('John Doe', 'HR');. To modify existing data, the UPDATE statement is used, like UPDATE employees SET department = 'Marketing' WHERE name = 'John Doe';. Finally, the DELETE statement removes records, as in DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';. These queries are the foundation for managing data in SQL.",
        "code": "SELECT * FROM table_name;\nInsert into Table_ name Values (Value1, value2, value 3)\nWhere variable = 'Condition'\nGROUP BY department\nHAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;\nORDER BY Salary",

    },
    "Basic Join": {
        "text": "Basic SQL joins are used to combine data from multiple tables. The `INNER JOIN` retrieves records that have matching values in both tables, like `SELECT employees.name, departments.name FROM employees INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;` which returns employee names and their corresponding department names. The `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table, along with matching records from the right table, such as `SELECT employees.name, departments.name FROM employees LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;`, which includes all employees even if they don't belong to a department. The `RIGHT JOIN` is similar but returns all records from the right table. The `FULL JOIN` returns records when there is a match in either table. These basic joins allow you to combine data from related tables based on a common column.",

    },
    "SubQuery": {
        "text": "A subquery is a query within another query, used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query. In a **SELECT** statement, a subquery can return values to filter the results. For example, `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');` retrieves employee names from the 'Sales' department. A **subquery in the FROM clause** can be used to treat the result as a table, like `SELECT avg_salary FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees) AS subquery;` which calculates the average salary from the employee table using a subquery. A **subquery in the WHERE clause** can also be used for more complex conditions, such as `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);` to find employees earning more than the average salary. Subqueries help make complex queries more manageable by breaking them into smaller, more focused queries.",
